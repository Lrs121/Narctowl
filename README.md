# Narctowl

# ~Narctowl is now a part of [PokEditor](https://github.com/turtleisaac/PokEditor), and therefore this version is discontinued. Please read PokEditor's README before attempting to use it.~ Narctowl (and PokEditor v1) (and PokEditor v2) are all discontinued and deprecated. For all intents and purposes, Narctowl is dead and no longer used in any context or in any tool. From this point onwards, use [Nds4j](https://github.com/turtleisaac/Nds4j) if you need to unpack or repack NARC files, as it contains the replacement functionality alongside much, much more.

Thanks/ Credits to:
 * PlatinumMaster for writing the python NARCTool version I used as a reference
 * Vendor, FrankieD, and Zekromaegis for updating and releasing new versions of PlatinumMaster's NARCTool
 * FrankieD for assisting me as we figured out how to read a narc and correctly extract other files from it

Usage is as follows: java -jar NARCtowl.jar <arguments> 
 * Unpacking: java -jar NARCtowl.jar unpack <file name (include .narc)> 
 * Packing: java -jar NARCtowl.jar pack \<name of directory in extracted folder> \<name of file to create (do not include .narc)> 
  * Note: Narc must be in the same folder as NARCtowl.jar 
  * Note: Directory to construct narc from must be in "extracted" directory
